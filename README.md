# rock_vs_mine_prediction
Employing Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression, the rock vs. mine prediction project utilizes supervised learning to classify sonar signals. Leveraging features extracted from sound data, the model distinguishes between rocks and mines with high accuracy.

My project, with the help of Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression, learns from data to decide whether it's hearing rocks or mines in sonar signals. It's like training a computer to recognize underwater sounds and tell us what's what, making things clearer in the ocean
